# How the course works

## 1. Communication Channels and Course Tools

- We use this site for most of our things.
- We use Slack for communication (if needed Discord as well).
- We use YouTube to distribute any pre-recorded lecture material.
- We will mostly use VSCode as our preferred IDE (widely used and useful to boot).
- We use GitHub to manage all code students write during the course, and to share code between students for pair programming.

A lot of this is new this year at ... and we're experimenting as we go. We appreciate your constructive feedback during the course!
