# An Introduction to JavaScript

What is JavaScript, what's the point of using JavaScript and what can we even do with it?

## What is "JavaScript"?

JS (short for JavaScript) was created to make web pages "alive".

The programs in this langauge are called *scripts* and they can be written directly into a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

These scripts are also executed as plain text, meaning that we don't need special compilers to run it. We just provide the scripts in its plain text form and It just works (as Todd Howard would put it).

By the way, be careful and don't get JavaScript confused with Java (which is another programming language).
