# Hello, world!

This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself.

But we need a working environment to run our scripts. Since this documentation is all online, the browser is a good choice. (Works regardless if you're on Chrome or Firefox, among other).

We'll also try to keep certain browser-specific commands like ``alert()`` to a minimum so that we don't get too accustomed to it since in the case where we're not in a browser and instead in a different environment (like Node.js) we'll be stumped. The print function in Node is ``console.log()``.
