# What is a Runtime?
{: .no_toc}

In JavaScript we don't need to necessarily install literally anything, reason being; since JavaScript is mostly used for scripting for the web we can literally just start programming in the browser. This is because Chrome for example, literally is running their scripts using V8 JavaScript engine which is native to the browser. (You might also know that Node.js is a runtime built on V8). Similarly, other browsers uses a runtime of its own like Firefox(SpiderMonkey), Opera(JavaScriptCore(JSC)/Nitro), and Edge(Chakra-> which got rebuilt using Chromium and v8)
